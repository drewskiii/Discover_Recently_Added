# Discover Recently Added
> Updates playlist for followers to view user's recently added tracks from the past week

This application compiles tracks the user added to their playlists from the past week and 
replaces the tracks from the selected playlist with the compiled tracks
for followers to listen in to what the user has newly added to their playlists. This is 
a fun way to connect with your followers and to seek songs they've interacted with, recently discovered, and even find new gems they found!
